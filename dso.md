Data Science Oath

* I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this
covenant:
* I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those data scientists in
whose steps I walk and gladly share such knowledge as is mine
with those who follow.
* I will apply, for the benefit of society, all measures which are
required, avoiding those twin traps of data-fishing and analytic
nihilism.
* I will remember that there is art to data science as well as science,
and that consistency, candor and compassion should outweigh the
algorithm’s precision or the interventionists influence.
* I will not be ashamed to say, “I know not,” nor will I fail to call in
my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for solving a
problem.
* I will respect the privacy of my data subjects, for their problems are
not disclosed to me that the world may know, so I will tread with
care in matters of privacy and security. If it is given to me to save
life with my analyses, all thanks. But it may also be within my
power to do harm and this responsibility must be faced with
humbleness and awareness of my own limitations.
* I will remember that my data are not just numbers without meaning
or context, but represent real people and situations and that my
work may lead to unintended societal consequences, such as
inequality, poverty, and disparities due to algorithmic bias. My
responsibility must consider potential consequences of my
extraction of meaning from data and ensure my analyses help
make better decisions.
* I will do personalization where appropriate, but I will always look
for a path to fair treatment and non-discrimination.
* I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special
obligations to all my fellow human beings, those who need help
and those who don’t.

If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy vitality and virtuosity,
respected for my contributions and remembered for my leadership
thereafter. May I always act to preserve the finest traditions of my
calling and may I long experience the joy of helping those who seek
my help
